//state  data  of  a  component

//why  its  called state  and  not  data

//data   of  a  component  that  u  create  inside  that  doesn't  come  externally  



function User ()

{
    // example   of  a  state 

   // let  name = "peter  Mumo";

    
    //return  (
         //<div className="user">
        //    <h1>Peter</h1>
        // </div>
    )
}
export default User;

/in  react   you  can  create   functions  inside  a  component

//onclick  is  a  reserved  keyword  in javascript  onClick;


state   is  adata  of  a  component  

and  if   the  data  cahanges  athe  ui   also  changes ,,  thats    why  is  not  called  normal  data   but  its  a  state  


//  how  to  create  a  state  variable  

//inbuilt   functions  that  help u  connect  to  react  functions  and  they  are  called  hooks


how  to  create  a  state  variable  .

wen  a  state  variable  changes   react  //rerenders / reloads /  refreshes  the  component
//only  that  component  is  refreshing  not    the  whole   web  application


beacause   the component  reacted  to  the  state  change   thats   why   
its  called  React  ..
